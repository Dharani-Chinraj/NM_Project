This project focuses on air quality monitoring in the 

environmental using AI. Air pollution affects our day to day activities 

and quality of air. Air pollution poses significant threats to public health 

and the environment worldwide. Monitoring and predicting air quality 

index (AQI) have become crucial for managing pollution levels and 

minimizing severe effects. In response to this challenge, we present an 

air pollution monitoring system leveraging machine learning techniques 

to predict AQI based on environmental factors such as temperature, 

humidity, and wind speed from the retrieved dataset.

 The system utilizes a Random Forest regression model, 

trained on historical data, to forecast AQI levels with high accuracy. By 

integrating real-time data acquisition and predictive analytics, the system 

offers timely insights into air quality conditions. The objectives of the 

system are to provide accurate and reliable predictions of AQI, raise 

awareness about air quality issues, and facilitate preemptive measures 

for pollution control and public health management .The systemâ€™s 

effectiveness is evaluated through precise testing and validation, 

ensuring its reliability and usability in real-world scenarios.

 Overall, the air pollution monitoring system serves as a 

valuable tool for environmental monitoring agencies and the general 

public, contributing to efforts aimed at improving air quality and 

safeguarding public health
